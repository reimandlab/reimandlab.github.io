JÃ¼ri Reimand collaborated with the pan-prostate cancer group, an international cancer genomics consortium, on a biomarker study of prostate cancer, published in [European Urology][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}. The team characterised rare germline variants in hallmark cancer pathways that are predictive of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.
