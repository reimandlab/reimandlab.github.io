JÃ¼ri Reimand collaborated with the Pan-Prostate Cancer Group (PPCG) a biomarker study of prostate cancer, published in [European Urology][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}. The team characterised rare germline variants in hallmark cancer pathways that are predictive of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. [PPCG][PPCG_link]{:target="_blank"} is an international cancer genomics consortium that collects whole-genome sequencing data of thousands of prostate cancers and analyses these data comprehensively for fundamental and translational insights.
