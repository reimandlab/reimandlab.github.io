Pan-cancer analysis of lncRNAs reveals prognostic transcripts with characteristic switch-like expression and a landscape of functional and pathway associations, published in [Cell Reports][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}.  Detailed experimental and clinical validation highlights the oncolncRNA HOXA10-AS whose activation in glioma associates with poor patient prognosis and cell proliferation and invasion phenotypes in cell lines, xenografts, and organoids.
