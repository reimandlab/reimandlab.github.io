Nina Adler and JÃ¼ri Reimand collaborated with Dzana Dervovic and Daniel Schramek at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute and UofT Department of Molecular Genetics on the systematic discovery of the regulators of immune therapy response in lung cancer. Nina led integrative pathway enrichment analyses to interpret the functional roles of the identified target genes in human lung cancers. The study was published this week in [Nature Communications][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}.
