We posted a new preprint on [bioRxiv][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}. Our integrative pan-cancer analysis shows that IP genes display highly-elevated expression patterns in subsets of cancer samples significantly more often than expected transcriptome-wide. To enable target identification, we identified 410 survival-associated IP genes in 29 cancer types using a machine learning approach.
