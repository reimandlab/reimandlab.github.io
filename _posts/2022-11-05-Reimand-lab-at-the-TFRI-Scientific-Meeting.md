Our lab attended the [9th Scientific Meeting][TFRI_link]{:target="_blank"} of the Terry Fox Research Institute on November 3-6 2022 in Vancouver BC. The PhD student Masroor Bayati received an award for his flash talk on the interactions of driver mutations and the tumor microenvironment (congrats!). JÃ¼ri Reimand presented an invited talk on the analysis of driver and passenger mutations in cancer genomes. Alec Bahcheli and Masroor Bayati also presented their research at the vibrant poster sessions.
