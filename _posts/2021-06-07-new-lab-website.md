The new website of Reimand lab is now available. We are in construction mode and things will be updated daily. The site is based on Jekyll and run on GitHub Pages. Check out the [current website][old-web]{:target="_blank"} for an overview of our lab and research (somewhat out of date). The most recent updates are often tweeted [here][reimand-twitter]{:target="_blank"}.
