Christian Lee and Jüri Reimand collaborated with Prof. Sean Egan’s team at SickKids Research Institute who led a comprehensive functional characterization of molecular drivers of breast cancer, published in [Nature Communications][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}. Christian performed a series of pathway enrichment analyses to characterize the accumulation of cancer-causing mutations in multiple mouse models of breast cancer that were systematically screened using the Sleeping Beauty method. Christian's enrichment maps with frequently mutated pathways and biological processes are shown in Figures 2,3 and 5 of the paper and provide leads for future studies of breast cancer and driver mutations.
