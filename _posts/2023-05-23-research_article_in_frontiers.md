Diogo Pellegrina co-led a collaboration with Dr. Mamatha Bhat (UHN) on the transcriptomic analysis of post-transplant liver disease that revealed dysregulation of wound healing pathways. The study was published this week in  [Frontiers in Endocrinology][paper_link]{:target="_blank"}. We profiled the transcriptomes of livers with post-transplant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (PT-NASH) from liver transplant recipients to identify dysregulated genes, pathways, and molecular interaction networks.
