(for post-pandemic F2F interactions): OICR is located in the MaRS Centre on the southeast corner of University/College intersection in downtown Toronto (see [Google Maps](http://eid.ee/41n)). The OICR reception is on the 5th floor of the West Tower of MaRS. After entering the MaRS building via the entrance on the University Avenue, you walk past a Starbucks Café on your right and turn right shortly after. You walk past a security desk on your left and turn right immediately to a set of three elevators (there is another set of elevators straight ahead; these won’t take you to OICR and provide access higher floors of the tower). Take the elevator to 5th floor and turn left. You will arrive at the OICR reception. The receptionist will let us know of your arrival.
