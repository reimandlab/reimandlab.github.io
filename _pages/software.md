##### ActivePathways

ActivePathways is an data fusion method for integrative pathway enrichment analysis of multi-omics datasets. It uses P-value merging to prioritize genes and pathways in multiple complementary omics datasets and evaluates the omics evidence supporting each detected pathway and gene. It can be integrated easily with the EnrichmentMap app in Cytoscape to visualize enriched pathways and underlying evidence.
