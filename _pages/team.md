I am an investigator of computational biology at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research. I also have a faculty appointment of assistant professor at the University of Toronto with the departments of Medical Biophysics and Molecular Genetics. I completed my PhD in computer science at the University of Tartu in Estonia in 2010 and my postdoctoral training at the Donnelly Centre of the University of Toronto during 2011-2015. I joined the OICR in summer of 2015. I am interested in computational biology, machine learning and cancer research.
