**JÃ¼ri Reimand (PI)**.
I am a principal investigator of computational biology at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (OICR) and assistant professor at the University of Toronto at the departments of Medical Biophysics and Molecular Genetics. I completed a PhD in computer science at the University of Tartu in Estonia in 2010 and postdoctoral training at the Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto (UofT) during 2011-2015. I started my lab at OICR and the UofT faculty appointment in 2015. I am interested in computational biology, machine learning and cancer research.
