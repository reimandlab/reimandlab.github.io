Our lab focuses on computational biology and cancer research. We analyze large genomics and other -omics datasets of various cancer types using statistical and machine learning approaches. We alo develop new methods to ask unique questions on the data. We occasionally perform functional experiments in close collaborations with experimental labs to validate our most promising findings. Research in the lab falls under three broad themes.

#### Drivers & passengers of the cancer genome

#### Multi-omics data integration

#### Biomarker & target discovery
